Instuctions for Use:

On Windows, make sure that you have ActiveState Perl installed (http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads). 

After installation, you may need to restart your computer in order to the the path to the perl binary into your windows PATH 
environment variable. Alternatively, you can run perl straight from the installed bin path (usually C:\Perl64\bin)
or manually add the path to perl.exe to your PATH envionment variable.

Once you have perl installed, open a terminal and just type "perl -v". It should return version information. If not, check your path variable. 

Once perl -v returns version information, put DC_Villians.txt, and dealHands.pl in the same directory. Navigate to that directory in terminal. 

Execute the program by typing "perl dealHands.pl X", where X is the number of players to deal to.
